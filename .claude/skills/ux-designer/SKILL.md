# UX Designer Skill

You are a UX design expert with comprehensive knowledge of modern user experience best practices (2026). Apply these principles when designing or reviewing interfaces.

## When to Apply This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Designing new user interfaces or components
- Reviewing existing UI/UX for improvements
- Implementing accessibility features
- Creating forms, navigation, or interactive elements
- Advising on mobile-first design
- Writing UI copy and microcopy
- Planning user research activities
- Building or maintaining design systems
- Designing collaborative/multiplayer features (real-time editing, presence)
- Building canvas-based or whiteboard applications
- Implementing sharing, permissions, or version control UX
- Designing AI-powered interfaces (chat, copilots, agents, generative UI)
- Evaluating designs for dark patterns and ethical compliance
- Creating onboarding flows, activation funnels, and first-run experiences
- Designing notification systems and attention management
- Building dashboards, data visualizations, and analytics interfaces
- Implementing search interfaces with autocomplete and filtering
- Applying emotional design principles and building user trust
- Internationalizing/localizing UI or adding right-to-left (RTL) language support
- Designing voice, multimodal, or cross-device input experiences

## Core Design Philosophy

### User-Centered Design
1. **Understand users first** - Research before designing
2. **Reduce cognitive load** - Keep interfaces simple and intuitive
3. **Provide feedback** - Every action should have a visible response
4. **Maintain consistency** - Follow established patterns users expect
5. **Design for accessibility** - Include all users from the start

### Calm & Clarity Over Complexity (2026)
- **Cognitive clarity over sensory richness** - Calm, legible interfaces beat busy,
  flashy ones. Motion, color, and density should earn their place by aiding
  understanding, not by impressing.
- **AI as a respectful copilot, not an autopilot** - Offer AI assistance optionally
  (sidebars, overlays, suggestions); keep the user in control and every AI action
  reversible and transparent. See [references/14-ai-ux-patterns.md](references/14-ai-ux-patterns.md).
- **Responsible adaptation over hyper-personalization** - Adapt to genuine user
  needs and context; avoid manipulative or opaque personalization.
- **Depth and judgment over polish** - As UI becomes a commodity, the value is in
  research, correctness, and knowing when *not* to add something.

### The UX Hierarchy of Needs
1. **Functional** - Does it work?
2. **Reliable** - Is it dependable?
3. **Usable** - Is it easy to use?
4. **Convenient** - Is it frictionless?
5. **Pleasurable** - Is it delightful?

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Before Designing
- [ ] Understand user goals and pain points
- [ ] Review existing patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Consider accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- [ ] Define success metrics

### Visual Design
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy (size, color, spacing)
- [ ] Consistent typography (16px+ body, 1.3-1.6x heading scale)
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for text)
- [ ] Adequate whitespace and breathing room

### Interaction Design
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44×44px (iOS) / 48×48dp (Android)

### Notifications
- [ ] Notification severity matches visual treatment
- [ ] Push permission requested in context (not on first visit)
- [ ] Users can control notification preferences per channel
- [ ] Toasts auto-dismiss (4-8s) with action button option

### Ethical Design
- [ ] Accept/reject buttons have equal visual prominence

- [ ] Cancellation is as easy as subscription
- [ ] No confirmshaming in decline copy

### Internationalization
- [ ] RTL-ready (logical CSS properties, layout verified in `dir="rtl"`)
- [ ] Tolerant of ~30-40% text expansion (no fixed-width labels/buttons)
- [ ] No text baked into images; all strings externalized
- [ ] Locale-aware date/number/currency formatting (`Intl`); ICU plurals
- [ ] Language switcher uses endonyms, not flags

## Decision Trees

### Modal vs. Side Panel vs. Full Page

```
What is the user doing?
├── Quick confirmation or simple input (1-3 fields)?
│   └── → Modal dialog
├── Viewing/editing details while keeping main context visible?
│   ├── Content is narrow (form, properties, chat)?
│   │   └── → Side panel
│   └── Content needs significant width?
│       └── → Full-page overlay (with back navigation)
├── Multi-step workflow or complex form?
│   ├── Steps are short (2-3 fields each)?
│   │   └── → Modal with stepper
│   └── Steps are long or need reference to other content?
│       └── → Full page with stepper
└── Creating a new complex entity (document, project)?
    └── → Full page (dedicated creation flow)
```

### Notification Type Selection

```
What needs the user's attention?
├── Immediate action required?
│   ├── Blocking (must resolve before continuing)?
│   │   └── → Modal dialog (confirmation, error recovery)
│   └── Non-blocking but urgent?
│       └── → Banner (top of page, persistent until dismissed)
├── Feedback on a completed action?
│   ├── Success or low-importance info?
│   │   └── → Toast (auto-dismiss 4-8s)
│   └── Warning or error?
│       └── → Toast with action button (manual dismiss)
├── Background event (new message, update from others)?
│   ├── User is in the same context?
│   │   └── → Badge + subtle inline indicator
│   └── User is elsewhere in the app?
│       └── → Badge on nav item + optional push notification
└── System status (maintenance, connectivity)?
    └── → Persistent banner (top or bottom of viewport)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Dark patterns** - Deceptive UI that tricks users → see [15-ethical-design.md](references/15-ethical-design.md)
2. **Infinite scroll without context** - No sense of progress → see [21-data-tables.md](references/21-data-tables.md)
3. **Hidden navigation** - Hamburger menus on desktop → see [05-information-architecture.md](references/05-information-architecture.md)
4. **Autoplaying media** - Unexpected sound/video → see [03-accessibility.md](references/03-accessibility.md)
5. **Disabled buttons without explanation** - Confusing blocked states → see [06-interaction-design.md](references/06-interaction-design.md)
6. **Walls of text** - No visual hierarchy or chunking → see [04-visual-design.md](references/04-visual-design.md)
7. **Color-only feedback** - Excludes colorblind users → see [03-accessibility.md](references/03-accessibility.md)
8. **Tiny touch targets** - Frustrating on mobile → see [08-mobile-ux.md](references/08-mobile-ux.md)
9. **No loading states** - Users think system is broken → see [22-performance-ux.md](references/22-performance-ux.md)
10. **Popup/modal overuse** - Interrupts user flow → see [06-interaction-design.md](references/06-interaction-design.md)
11. **No presence indicators** - Users don't know who else is working → see [12a-presence-awareness.md](references/12a-presence-awareness.md)
12. **Silent sync failures** - Data loss without warning → see [12b-conflict-resolution-sync.md](references/12b-conflict-resolution-sync.md)
13. **Cursor overload** - Too many live cursors create visual noise → see [12a-presence-awareness.md](references/12a-presence-awareness.md)
14. **Screen-center zoom** - Disorienting; zoom at cursor instead → see [13a-canvas-navigation.md](references/13a-canvas-navigation.md)
15. **No offline indication** - Users think they're connected when not → see [12b-conflict-resolution-sync.md](references/12b-conflict-resolution-sync.md)
16. **Hidden AI** - Users should always know when interacting with AI → see [14-ai-ux-patterns.md](references/14-ai-ux-patterns.md)
17. **Over-automation** - AI changes applied without user awareness or consent → see [14-ai-ux-patterns.md](references/14-ai-ux-patterns.md)
18. **No AI undo** - AI-applied changes must be reversible → see [14-ai-ux-patterns.md](references/14-ai-ux-patterns.md)
19. **Confirmshaming** - Guilt-laden language on decline buttons → see [15-ethical-design.md](references/15-ethical-design.md)
20. **Asymmetric consent** - Big "Accept" button, tiny "Reject" link → see [15-ethical-design.md](references/15-ethical-design.md)
21. **Mandatory lengthy tours** - Forcing users through 10+ onboarding steps → see [16-onboarding.md](references/16-onboarding.md)
22. **Notification carpet bombing** - Every event as a push notification → see [17-notifications.md](references/17-notifications.md)
23. **Permission on first visit** - Asking for push permission before user sees value → see [17-notifications.md](references/17-notifications.md)
24. **Hardcoded/untranslatable strings** - Text baked into code/images, fixed-width containers, LTR-only layout → see [23-internationalization.md](references/23-internationalization.md)
25. **Voice-only flows / hidden mic** - No fallback modality, no recognition feedback, buried voice entry → see [24-voice-and-multimodal.md](references/24-voice-and-multimodal.md)
